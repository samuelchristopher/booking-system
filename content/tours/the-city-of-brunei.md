  Brunei is a tiny nation on the island of Borneo, in 2 distinct sections
  surrounded by Malaysia and South China Sea. It's known for its beaches and
  biodiverse rainforest, much of it protected within reserves. The capital,
  Bandar Seri Begawan, is home to the opulent Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah mosque
  and its 29 golden domes. The capital's massive Istana Nurul Iman palace is the
  residence of Brunei's ruling sultan.
